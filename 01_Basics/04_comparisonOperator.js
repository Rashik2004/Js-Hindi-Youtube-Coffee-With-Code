let a=12
//let b=8
//console.log(a>b)
//console.log(a>=b)
//console.log(a<b)
//console.log(a<=b)
//console.log(a==b)
//console.log(a!=b)
//the above comaprasion from same datatypes are a bit easy and simple.

//But the problem arises when we try to compare different datatype using these operators

//let str1="apple"
//let str2="12"
//console.log(a>str1)
//console.log(a>=str2)

//console.log(null>0)
//console.log(null>=0)
//console.log(0==null)
//console.log(undefined==0)

//in javascript == checks only the equality of the values
//in javascript === is called is strict check as they not only checks the equality but also checks the datatypes for equality

console.log("2"==2)
console.log("2"===2)
